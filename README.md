Disc Finder can be used offline and all search features are included for FREE, no advertisements. The app will make it easy to search and compare discs across many of the major disc manufacturers. The goal with this project was to make a portable pocket guide that will make it convenient to compare discs, browse for replacement discs, or just to help you disc up.

Ways to search:</br>
•	Compare two brands by disc type</br>
•	Show similar discs based on you search results</br>
•	Search for a specific disc mold or view all discs by brand</br>
•	Advanced search for Speed, Glide, and Stability</br>
•	Compare plastic types across manufacturers</br>

<strong>Other uses:</strong></br>
•	Offline pocket reference for discs</br>
•	Finding replacement discs or comparable discs</br>
•	Details for store merchants or disc golf coaches</br>
•	Identify worn stamps or discs without markings</br>
•	Identify old specialty tournament or promo discs</br>
•	Compare plastic types across manufacturers</br>

The database includes many new discs released up to 2023. Future updates will include new features and new release discs. The current database does not include retired and out-of-circulation discs. Disc images are not included by design to keep the app lean.
